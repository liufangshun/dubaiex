				<h2>Transfer of personal information overseas</h2>
				<p>We may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients in order to provide our services and for administrative, data storage or other business management purposes.  It is not practicable to list all of the countries to which your information may be transmitted from time to time, but we transfer information to recipients in Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</p>
				<p>Before disclosing any personal information to an overseas recipient, we take steps reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the overseas recipient complies with relevant Privacy Laws or is bound by a substantially similar privacy scheme to that which is in place in Australia, unless you specifically consent to the overseas disclosure taking place without such steps being taken, or the disclosure is otherwise required or permitted by law. </p>
				<h2>Direct marketing and your information</h2>
				<p>We may use your information to advertise or promote products, services, or business or investment opportunities we think may interest you, including by email or telephone. We may also provide your information to other organisations for specific marketing purposes. However, we will not do so where you tell us not to.</p>
				<p>You can ask us not to contact you about products and services and not to disclose your information to others for that purpose by contacting the support team using the tab on our website.</p>
				<h2>Security of your personal information</h2>
				<p>We hold your personal information in physical form or in electronic form on our premises and systems, or offsite using the premises and systems of our service providers.  These premises and systems are accessible only by authorised staff, and follow procedural safeguards that meet or exceed relevant Privacy Law.</p>
				<p>We take steps reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the personal information we hold is protected from misuse, interference and loss and from unauthorised access, disclosure or modification.</p>
				<p>We require third parties handling personal information on our behalf to follow equally compliant standards of security and confidentiality.</p>
				<p>When we no longer need your information, including when we are no longer required or authorised by law to keep records relating to you, we will destroy it or de-identify it.</p>
				<h2>Accessing and correcting your personal information</h2>
				<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information we handle is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading.</p>
				<p>You have the right to request to access your personal information held by us and correct it if you believe that it is inaccurate, out-of-date or incomplete.</p>
				<p>You may request access to, or correction of, the information we hold about you at any time by contacting the support team using the tab on our website.  We will grant access to personal information to the extent required by applicable Privacy Law and will take reasonable steps to correct personal information where necessary and appropriate.</p>
				<p>We will respond to your access or correction request within a reasonable time. There is no fee for making a request, but we may charge you the reasonable costs of providing our response to a request for access to personal information.</p>
				<p>If we refuse to give you access to any of your personal information, we will provide you with reasons for the refusal and the relevant provisions of the Privacy Law on which we rely to refuse access.</p>
				<p>In the event that we correct your personal information previously disclosed to another entity and you request that other entity to be notified of the correction, we will take reasonable steps in the circumstances to do so unless impracticable or unlawful.</p>
				<p>If we do not agree with the corrections you have requested, we are not obliged to amend your information, however, we will give you a written notice which sets out the reasons for our refusal.</p>
